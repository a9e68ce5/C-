# Find approximate solution and min distance
* Suppose there is a function
  $$f(x) = x^{2} â€“ 0.2x - 0.4$$ you are required to design a C++ program to find a(or an approximation) solution $x$ and the minimum distance dMin ( i.e., minimum of $|f(x)|$ ) for the function $f(x)$ between the interval $[0.0,1.0]$.
