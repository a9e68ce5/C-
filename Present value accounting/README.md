# Present value accounting
* Present value (PV) is an accounting term that measures how much money should be invested today in order to finance future business initiatives, projects, and obligations. The standard formula for calculating the present value of a series of future receipts is:
$$PV=PMTÃ—(\frac{1-(1+r/12)^{-n})}{(r/12)})$$
where PMT is the monthly cash flow occurred for the future receipts, r the yearly interest rate appropriate for the stated period, and n the number of periods over which future receipts occur. 
* Write a program that can analyze the impact of interest rate changes on monthly payment, where the interest rate varies from 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, .... , 2.9%, to 3.0%.
